    "\n",
    "    - the first parameter of the function (file) specifies the name of the file to be associated with the stream;\n",
    "\n",
    "    - the second parameter (mode) specifies the open mode used for the stream; it's a string filled with a sequence of characters, and each of them has its own special meaning (more details soon);\n",
    "\n",
    "    - the third parameter (encoding) specifies the encoding type (e.g., UTF-8 when working with text files)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - the opening must be the very first operation performed on the stream.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Note: the mode and encoding arguments may be omitted - their default values are assumed then. The default opening mode is reading in text mode, while the default encoding depends on the platform used.\n",

    "    - the file associated with the stream doesn't need to exist if it doesn't exist it will be created; if it exists, it will be truncated to the length of zero (erased); if the creation isn't possible (e.g., due to system permissions) the open() function raises an exception.\n",
